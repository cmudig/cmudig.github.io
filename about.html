<h2>What Motivates Us</h2>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  We are passionate about helping people make sense of data. Data permeates many
  aspects of our lives today. Data scientists analyze data to provide
  information for data-driven decisions or scientific discoveries. Informed
  citizens use data to keep their representatives accountable. Machine learning
  engineers use data to train models that help us take better pictures, suggest
  people we may want to follow, or decides whether we get a loan. In our group,
  we want to use our expertise in system building and design to help everyone
  uncover insights in data and understand how data is used to make decisions
  that affect their lives.

<h2>Our Values</h2>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  <strong>People matter.</strong> Teams are more successful when everybody is
  happy. We are all human and strive for an inclusive environment. We care about
  work-life balance. We celebrate successes and learn from failures.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  <strong>Simple but not easy.</strong> We strive to find simple solutions and
  principles to solve complex problem. Finding simple solutions doesn't mean
  it's easy but it means that the end result is usable and clearly communicated.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  <strong>Execution matters.</strong> There are a lot of good ideas but a good
  idea only becomes a successful idea when it is well-executed and clearly
  communicated. We care about meaningful impact.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  <strong>Pragmatism over dogmatism.</strong> Break rules when you have to and
  adjust your principles when it doesn't match reality.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
  <strong>We don't live in a bubble.</strong> Scientists can't be in a bubble.
  We have to care about the societal, ecological, and economical impact of our
  work. We have to help fight discrimination, climate change, and poverty.
</p>
