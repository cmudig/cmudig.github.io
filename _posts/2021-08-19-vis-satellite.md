We are hosting an [IEEE VIS 2021 Satellite Event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/satellite) at Carnegie Mellon University. VIS is the premier visualization conference. It usually happens every year in a different city around the world, but due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, it will be virtual this year. To foster the local visualization community, we are hosting an in-person event during the conference.

We will be live-streaming the opening and closing sessions on October 26 and 29 from [Gates Hillman Centers](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=192#!m/15778?ct/51581,7382), GHC 4405. We will also provide space for people to meet and get to know other visualization researchers or enthusiasts.
