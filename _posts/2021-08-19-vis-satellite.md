We are hosting an [IEEE VIS 2021 Satellite Event](http://ieeevis.org/year/2021/info/satellite) at Carnegie Mellon University. VIS is the premier visualization conference. It usually happens every year in a different city around the world, but due to the ongoing COVID pandemic, it will be virtual this year. To foster the local visualization community, we are hosting an in-person event during the conference.

We will be live-streaming the shared events on **October 26 and 29** from [Gates Hillman Centers](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=192#!m/15778?ct/51581,7382), GHC 4405. We will also provide space for people to meet and get to know other visualization researchers or enthusiasts.

We will announce a detailed schedule here before the event.

We organize the event following CMU's COVID regulations. We expect everyone to be vaccinated to attend the event. We may adjust the schedule or cancel if the situation changes dramatically.

If you want to attend or sponsor the VIS Satellite, we will provide contact information here shortly.

The organizers of the event are Adam Perer, Yu-Ru Lin, and Dominik Moritz.
