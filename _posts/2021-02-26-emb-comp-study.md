Visualizing high-dimensional embedding spaces using tSNE/UMAP can shed light on how a model organizes its input data. However, most of these visualizations are static and are quite difficult to compare from one model to another. We're building a tool that helps to visually compare and inspect multiple embedding spaces, opening up new possibilities for exploratory analysis. In order to establish how embedding users understand and use their data, we are interviewing embedding model experts across domains like NLP, computer vision, and computational biology. People whoâ€™ve worked extensively with embedding models in a current or past project are ideal. After that, we're hoping that some of these experts can try the system on their own datasets and provide feedback.
