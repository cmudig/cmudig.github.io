We are excited to introduce the logo for the Data Interaction Group. The logo is a version of [CMU's mascot Scotty](https://athletics.cmu.edu/athletics/mascot/index), the Scottish terrier, digging. You may interpret it as the dog digging up some hidden insight in data.

The logo and its sources are [on GitHub](https://github.com/cmudig/logo). It was created by a friend of the lab [Lilian de Greef](https://www.ldegreef.com).
