Both Adam and Dominik are looking for PhD students for 2021 who are excited about visualization, human-centered machine learning, and data science. If you want to work with us, please apply to the [HCII PhD program](https://hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci/application). The GRE is not required this year. We also advise students in other PhD programs in our [School of Computer Science](https://scsdean.cs.cmu.edu/admissions/index.html).

We look forward to your application. If you have any questions, please reach out to us.
