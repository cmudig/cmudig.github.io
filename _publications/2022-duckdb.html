We introduce DuckDB-Wasm, a WebAssembly version of the data- base system DuckDB,
to provide fast analytical processing for the Web. DuckDB-Wasm evaluates SQL
queries asynchronously in web workers, supports efficient user-defined functions
written in JavaScript, and features a browser-agnostic filesystem that reads
local and remote data in pages. DuckDB-Wasm outperforms previ- ous data
processing libraries for the Web in the TPC-H benchmark at multiple scale
factors. We demonstrate the capabilities of an analytical database in the
browser using an interactive SQL shell.
