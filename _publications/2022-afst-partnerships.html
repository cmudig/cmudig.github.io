AI-based decision support tools (ADS) are increasingly used to augment human
decision-making in high-stakes, social contexts. As public sector agencies begin
to adopt ADS, it is critical that we understand workers' experiences with these
systems in practice. In this paper, we present findings from a series of
interviews and contextual inquiries at a child welfare agency, to understand how
they currently make AI-assisted child maltreatment screening decisions. Overall,
we observe how workers' reliance upon the ADS is guided by (1) their knowledge
of rich, contextual information beyond what the AI model captures, (2) their
beliefs about the ADS's capabilities and limitations relative to their own, (3)
organizational pressures and incentives around the use of the ADS, and (4)
awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and their own
decision-making objectives. Drawing upon these findings, we discuss design
implications towards supporting more effective human-AI decision-making.
