Understanding predictive models, in terms of interpreting and identifying
actionable insights, is a challenging task. Often the importance of a feature in
a model is only a rough estimate condensed into one number. However, our
research goes beyond these naïve estimates through the design and implementation
of an interactive visual analytics system, Prospector. By providing interactive
partial dependence diagnostics, data scientists can understand how features
affect the prediction overall. In addition, our support for localized inspection
allows data scientists to understand how and why specific datapoints are
predicted as they are, as well as support for tweaking feature values and seeing
how the prediction responds. Our system is then evaluated using a case study
involving a team of data scientists improving predictive models for detecting
the onset of diabetes from electronic medical records.
