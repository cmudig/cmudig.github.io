Many researchers across diverse disciplines aim to analyze the behavior of
cohorts whose behaviors are recorded in large event databases. However,
extracting cohorts from databases is a difficult yet important step, often
overlooked in many analytical solutions. This is especially true when
researchers wish to restrict their cohorts to exhibit a particular temporal
pattern of interest. In order to fill this gap, we designed COQUITO, a visual
interface that assists users defining cohorts with temporal constraints. COQUITO
was designed to be comprehensible to domain experts with no preknowledge of
database queries and also to encourage exploration. We then demonstrate the
utility of COQUITO via two case studies, involving medical and social media
researchers.
