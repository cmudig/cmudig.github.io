While many visualization specification languages are user-friendly, they tend to
have one critical drawback: they are designed for small data on the client-side
and, as a result, perform poorly at scale. We propose a system that takes
declarative visualization specifications as input and automatically optimizes
the resulting visualization execution plans by offloading
computational-intensive operations to a separate database management system
(DBMS). Our demo will enable users to write their own Vega specifications (or
import existing ones), view the optimized plans from our system, and even modify
these plans and compare their performance via a dedicated performance dashboard.
