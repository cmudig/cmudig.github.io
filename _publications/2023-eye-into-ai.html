Recent developments in explainable AI (XAI) aim to improve the transparency of
black-box models. However, empirically evaluating the interpretability of these
XAI techniques is still an open challenge. The most common evaluation method is
algorithmic performance, but such an approach may not accurately represent how
interpretable these techniques are to people. A less common but growing
evaluation strategy is to leverage crowd-workers to provide feedback on multiple
XAI techniques to compare them. However, these tasks often feel like work and
may limit participation. We propose a novel, playful, human-centered method for
evaluating XAI techniques: a Game With a Purpose (GWAP), Eye into AI, that
allows researchers to collect human evaluations of XAI at scale. We provide an
empirical study demonstrating how our GWAP supports evaluating and comparing the
agreement between three popular XAI techniques (LIME, Grad-CAM, and Feature
Visualization) and humans, as well as evaluating and comparing the
interpretability of those three XAI techniques applied to a deep learning model
for image classification. The data collected from Eye into AI offers convincing
evidence that GWAPs can be used to evaluate and compare XAI techniques.
