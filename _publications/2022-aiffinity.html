Data scientists require rich mental models of how AI systems behave to
effectively train, debug, and work with them. Despite the prevalence of AI
analysis tools, there is no general theory describing how people make sense of
what their models have learned. We frame this process as a form of sensemaking
and derive a framework describing how data scientists develop mental models of
AI behavior. To evaluate the framework, we show how existing AI analysis tools
fit into this sensemaking process and use it to design AIFinnity, a system for
analyzing image-and-text models. Lastly, we explored how data scientists use a
tool developed with the framework through a think-aloud study with 10 data
scientists tasked with using AIFinnity to pick an image captioning model. We
found that AIFinnity's sensemaking workflow reflected participants' mental
processes and enabled them to discover and validate diverse AI behaviors.
