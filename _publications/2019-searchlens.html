Whether figuring out where to eat in an unfamiliar city or deciding which
apartment to live in, consumer generated data (i.e. reviews and forum posts) are
often an important influence in online decision making. To make sense of these
rich repositories of diverse opinions, searchers need to sift through a large
number of reviews to characterize each item based on aspects that they care
about. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, where searchers build up a
collection of "Lenses" that reflect their different latent interests, and
compose the Lenses to find relevant items across different contexts. Based on
the Lenses, SearchLens generates personalized interfaces with visual
explanations that promotes transparency and enables deeper exploration. While
prior work found searchers may not wish to put in effort specifying their goals
without immediate and sufficient benefits, results from a controlled lab study
suggest that our approach incentivized participants to express their interests
more richly than in a baseline condition, and a field study showed that
participants found benefits in SearchLens while conducting their own tasks.
