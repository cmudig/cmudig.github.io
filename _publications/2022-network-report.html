The rapid development of network science and technologies de- pends on shareable
datasets. Currently, there is no standard practice for reporting and sharing
network datasets. Some network dataset providers only share links, while others
provide some contexts or basic statistics. As a result, critical information may
be unintentionally dropped, and network dataset consumers may misunderstand or
overlook critical aspects. Inappropriately using a network dataset can lead to
severe consequences (e.g., discrimination) especially when machine learning
models on networks are deployed in high- stake domains. Challenges arise as
networks are often used across different domains (e.g., network science,
physics, etc) and have com- plex structures. To facilitate the communication
between network dataset providers and consumers, we propose network report. A
network report is a structured description that summarizes and contextualizes a
network dataset. Network report extends the idea of dataset reports (e.g.,
Datasheets for Datasets) from prior work with network-specific descriptions of
the non-i.i.d. nature, demographic information, network characteristics, etc. We
hope network reports encourage transparency and accountability in network
research and development across different fields.
