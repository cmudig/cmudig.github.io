We present DashQL, a language that describes complete analysis workflows in
self-contained scripts. DashQL combines SQL, the grammar of relational database
systems, with a grammar of graphics in a grammar of analytics. It supports
preparing and visualizing arbitrarily complex SQL statements in a single
coherent language. The proximity to SQL facilitates holistic optimizations of
analysis workflows covering data input, encoding, transformations, and
visualizations. These optimizations use model and query metadata for
visualization-driven aggregation, remote predicate pushdown, and adaptive
materialization. We introduce the DashQL language as an extension of SQL and
describe the efficient and interactive processing of text-based analysis
workflows.
