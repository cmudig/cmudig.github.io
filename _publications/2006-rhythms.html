Social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a powerful method for understanding
the importance of relationships in networks. However, interactive exploration of
networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns
and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2)
current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming
visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an
orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our
contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social
networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute
ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA
measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to
gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using
link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest,
and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find
patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each
operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so
users can make comparisons. SocialAction offers analysts a strategy beyond
opportunism, as it provides systematic, yet flexible, techniques for exploring
social networks.
