Legible labels should not overlap with other marks in a chart. The
state-of-the-art labeling algorithm detects overlaps using a set of points to
approximate each markâ€™s shape. This approach is inefficient for large marks or
many marks as it requires too many points to detect overlaps. In response, we
present a Bitmap-Based label placement algorithm, which leverages occupancy
bitmap to accelerate overlap detection. To create an occupancy bitmap, we
rasterize marks onto a bitmap based on the area they occupy in the chart. With
the bitmap, we can efficiently place labels without overlapping existing marks,
regardless of the number and geometric complexity of the marks. This
Bitmap-Based algorithm offers significant performance improvements over the
state-of-the-art approach while placing a similar number of labels.
