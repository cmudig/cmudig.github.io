AI systems can fail to learn important behaviors, leading to real-world issues
like safety concerns and biases. Unfortunately, discovering these systematic
failures often requires significant developer attention, from hypothesizing
potential edge cases to collecting evidence and validating patterns. To scale
and streamlinethis process, we introduce failure reports, end-user descriptions
of how or why a model failed, and show how developers can use them to detect AI
errors. We also design and implement Deblinder, a visual analytics system for
synthesizing failure reports that developers can use to discover and validate
systematic failures. In semi-structured interviews and think-aloud studies with
10 AI practitioners, we explore the affordances of the Deblindersystem and the
applicability of failure reports in real-world settings. Lastly, we show how
collecting additional data from the groups identified by developers can improve
model performance.
