As people continue to author and share increasing amounts of information in
social media, the opportunity to leverage such information for relationship
discovery tasks increases. In this paper, we describe a set of systems that
mine, aggregate, and infer a social graph from social media inside an
enterprise, resulting in over 73 million relationships between 450,000 people.
We then describe SaNDVis, a novel visual analytics tool that supports
people-centric tasks like expertise location, team building, and team
coordination in the enterprise. We provide details of a 22-month-long,
large-scale deployment to over 2,300 users from which we analyze longitudinal
usage patterns, classify types of visual analytics queries and users, and
extract dominant use cases from log and interview data. By integrating social
position, evidence, and facets into SaNDVis, we demonstrate how users can use a
visual analytics tool to reflect on existing relationships as well as build new
relationships in an enterprise setting.
