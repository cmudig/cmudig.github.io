In this experience report, we offer a case study of blind and sighted colleagues
creating an accessible workflow to collaborate on a data visualization-focused
project. We outline our process for making the project's shared data
representations accessible through incorporating both handmade and
machine-embossed tactile graphics. We also share lessons and strategies for
considering team needs and addressing contextual constraints like remote
collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic. More broadly, this report
contributes to ongoing research into the ways accessibility is interdependent by
arguing that access work must be a collective responsibility and properly
supported with recognition, resources, and infrastructure.
