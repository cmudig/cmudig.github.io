The study of complex activities such as scientific production and software
development often requires modeling connections among heterogeneous entities
including people, institutions, and artifacts. Despite advances in algorithms
and visualization techniques for understanding such social networks, the process
of constructing network models and performing exploratory analysis remains
difficult and time-consuming. In this article, we present Orion, a system for
interactive modeling, transformation, and visualization of network data. Orion's
interface enables the rapid manipulation of large graphs—including the
specification of complex linking relationships—using simple drag-and-drop
operations with desired node types. Orion maps these user interactions to
statements in a declarative workflow language that incorporates both relational
operators (e.g. selection, aggregation, and joins) and network analytics (e.g.
centrality measures). We demonstrate how these features enable analysts to
flexibly construct and compare networks in domains such as online health
communities, electronic medical records, academic collaboration, and distributed
software development.
