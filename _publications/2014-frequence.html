Extracting insights from temporal event sequences is an important challenge. In
particular, mining frequent patterns from event sequences is a desired
capability for many domains. However, most techniques for mining frequent
patterns are ineffective for real-world data that may be low-resolution,
concurrent, or feature many types of events, or the algorithms may produce
results too complex to interpret. To address these challenges, we propose
Frequence, an intelligent user interface that integrates data mining and
visualization in an interactive hierarchical information exploration system for
finding frequent patterns from longitudinal event sequences. Frequence features
a novel frequent sequence mining algorithm to handle multiple levels-of-detail,
tempo- ral context, concurrency, and outcome analysis. Frequence also features a
visual interface designed to support insights, and support exploration of
patterns of the level-of-detail relevant to users. Frequence's effectiveness is
demonstrated with two use cases: medical research mining event sequences from
clinical records to understand the progression of a disease, and social network
research using frequent sequences from Foursquare to understand the mobility of
people in an urban environment.
