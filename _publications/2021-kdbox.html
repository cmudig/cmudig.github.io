Time-series data—usually presented in the form of lines—plays an important role
in many domains such as finance, meteorology, health, and urban informatics.
Yet, little has been done to support interactive exploration of large-scale
time-series data, which requires a clutter-free visual representation with
low-latency interactions. In this paper, we contribute a novel
line-segment-based KD-tree method to enable interactive analysis of many time
series. Our method enables not only fast queries over time series in selected
regions of interest but also a line splatting method for efficient computation
of the density field and selection of representative lines. Further, we develop
KD-Box, an interactive system that provides rich interactions, e.g., timebox,
attribute filtering, and coordinated multiple views. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of KD-Box in supporting efficient line query and density field
computation through a quantitative comparison and show its usefulness for
interactive visual analysis on several real-world datasets.
