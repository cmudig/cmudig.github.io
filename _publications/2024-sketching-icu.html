Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities, yet innovation teams struggle when envisioning AI concepts. Data
science teams think of innovations users do not want, while domain experts think
of innovations that cannot be built. A lack of effective ideation seems to be a
breakdown point. How might multidisciplinary teams identify buildable and
desirable use cases? This paper presents a first hand account of ideating AI
concepts to improve critical care medicine. As a team of data scientists,
clinicians, and HCI researchers, we conducted a series of design workshops to
explore more effective approaches to AI concept ideation and problem
formulation. We detail our process, the challenges we encountered, and practices
and artifacts that proved effective. We discuss the research implications for
improved collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and discuss the role HCI
might play in reducing the high failure rate experienced in AI innovation.
